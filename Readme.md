# Young Professionals E-Commerce

## Project Description
This is an e-commerce website designed for young professionals. It offers a variety of products designed to help them in their professional and personal lives. The site includes product listings, a shopping cart, and a checkout process, with all data being stored in the browser's localStorage.

## Features
- **Product Display**: Dynamic product grid displaying various items.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add/remove products, and the cart updates in real-time.
- **Local Storage**: Cart data is persisted in localStorage to ensure it stays between page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout, designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Design Choices
The website uses a modern, clean layout suitable for young professionals. I chose a minimalistic color scheme with soft backgrounds and dark contrasting elements for navigation. The site is designed to look professional while being easy to use and visually appealing.

## JavaScript Features
- **Cart Management**: Add products to the cart, view cart details, and remove products.
- **Cart Count Update**: The cart icon in the header updates dynamically to show the number of items in the cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Checkout alert to notify users of the completion.
