Design Fce
For the design of this e-commerce website, I aimed to create a clean, professional, and 
modern layout suitable for young professionals. I chose a minimalistic color scheme with 
light background colors (e.g., #f7f2f2) to ensure the website feels fresh and easy on the eyes. 
I used dark shades for the header and footer to create contrast and to highlight important sections
like navigation and cart. The layout is responsive, ensuring the website adapts well to mobile and desktop devices.

JavaScript Features:

I implemented several interactive features using JavaScript to enhance the user experience. These include:

Dynamic cart functionality: Users can add products to the cart, view their cart.
The cart is saved in localStorage so that data persists across page reloads.
Cart count update: The cart icon dynamically updates with the number of items in the cart, 
providing real-time feedback to users.
Challenges and Solutions:

One challenge I faced was managing cart data using localStorage. Initially, I had issues with data not 
persisting across sessions. To resolve this, I made sure to consistently update localStorage after any change to the cart, ensuring the cart data is reliably stored and retrieved on page load.

Deployment Process:

I deployed the website using GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing. The steps involved initializing a Git repository,
 pushing the project files to GitHub, and using the "GitHub Pages" feature to serve the files from the repository.
